# Music-Genre-Detection-with-Live-Audio
Developed a machine learning model to classify music genres from audio data with an accuracy of 94.5%. Implemented the model using a deep learning approach with a convolutional neural network (CNN) and optimized using the Adam optimizer with sparse categorical cross-entropy loss. Built a user-friendly interface on a Kaggle notebook
